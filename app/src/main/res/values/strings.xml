    <p>The care of a cow during pregnancy will depend on the well-being of the calf, milk production, well-being of the
        cow and immunity to postpartum disease. Basically, the care of a pregnant cow needs to be taken specially from
        three months before giving birth, such as a balanced concentration supply, raw grass and adequate supply of hay,
        vitamins and minerals. A healthy mother can give birth to a healthy baby. Therefore, pregnant cows need special
        care to get a healthy calf. The special care of pregnant cows is mentioned below:</p> <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            &#160;In addition to ensuring adequate and regular balanced concentration feeding for pregnant cows and unborn
            calves, fiber food, vitamins and minerals should be provided.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;Milking should be stopped as per proper plan two to three months before the birth of the calf.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;Separate accommodation should be provided for pregnant cows, the accommodation must be clean and dry.
            Moreover, dry hay should be spread for sleeping and cows should not be kept in high and low places.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;Take regular baths but need to be careful not to feel extra cold or hot to cows. If there is lice or on the
            cow, it should be cleaned.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;Necessary measures should be taken to be aware of the time of delivery. In this case, if the cow gives birth
            at night, the farm worker must keep a watchful eye, otherwise the cow may eat the uterus.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;After the onset of calving symptoms, all kinds of preparations need to be done such as disinfection of the
            maternity ward and comfortable environment for the cow.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;After giving birth to the baby, mix Dettol in a little hot water and wash the placenta well with that water.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;The cow should be provided with lukewarm water so that the placenta falls easily to the ground and should be
            buried in the ground as soon as possible as soon as the placenta falls as milk production is severely
            reduced if the cow eats the placenta.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;If the uterus does not fall within 24 hours of giving birth, you should seek the help of a veterinarian.

    <![CDATA[
    <p>Gestational care of calves usually refers to the care of pregnant cows. Milking of pregnant cows should be
        stopped from 3 months before the birth of the calf and at this time the cows should be provided an adequate
        amount of nutritious food. If the delivery is near, the pregnant cow should be kept separate from other cows.
    </p> <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            &#160;Before the calf is delivered, the calf placement area must be kept clean so that no germs can be
            transmitted.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;The calf should be placed on dry straw or sack immediately after delivery to remove lubricants and blood
            from the nose and mouth.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;Arrangements should be made so that the cow can lick and clean the body of the calf. This will not cause
            pneumonia in the calf as well as increase the blood circulation in the body of the calf.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;The calf\'s navel should be cut two inches with a sharp blade or scissors at the time of delivery and then
            apply povicep to that area.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;The udder of the cow should be cleaned with lukewarm water and colostrum should be given to the calf as soon
            as possible after birth. However, the calf must be fed colostrum within 6 hours of birth.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;If the calf has difficulty in breathing then hold the back two legs and shake them gently. If necessary,
            artificial respiration should be started by blowing through the nostrils. Otherwise the calf will die.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;The calf should be fed concentrated food, hay and green grass from 3 weeks after birth. Milk replacer and
            cuff starter can be fed if required.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;Always keep the calf close to the cow. The calf bed should be made by spreading dry straw or sack in the
            barn.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;Occasionally straw / sack should be changed and dried in the sun.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;The calf should be kept in a warm, soft and dry place.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;During the winter, the body of the calf should be covered with cloth or sack.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;The calf should be bathed regularly
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;The calf should be weighed regularly to help determine the calf\'s feed intake and growth rate.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;From the age of one month, calves should be given deworming drugs.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;When the calf is 4 months old, it is necessary to stop milk feeding.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            &#160;In case of calf disease, a skilled and experienced veterinarian should be consulted
